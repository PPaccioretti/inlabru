\title{Construct tensor product integration schemes for multiple domains and subregions}
\usage{
apmaker(
  domain = NULL,
  samplers = NULL,
  weight = "weight",
  int.args = list(method = "stable", nsub = NULL),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{domain}{A list of named integration definitions, each either
character/factor vector, a numeric vector of points given integration
weight 1, an \code{inla.mesh.1d} object, or an \code{inla.mesh.2d} object. Only those
domains that are not given in the \code{samplers} data.frame are used, plus the
coordinates object, used for the spatial aspect of the \code{samplers} object.
TODO * 20221212 For extension, it can be factor or character while keeping
the level to map them back to the components}

\item{samplers}{A (list of unnamed or named element(s) of ) \verb{[sf/sfc]DataFrame} or
\verb{Spatial[Points/Lines/Polygons]DataFrame} object(s). Unnamed elements
are assumed to be multidomain samplers; named elements are singledomain
samplers; domains without corresponding samplers are assumed to be full domain
samplers.
TODO is response useful here? 20220130}

\item{weight}{The name of integration weight column in the samplers. Default: \code{weight}
TODO 1) how about domain? should not be allowed.
2) allow_names should be bru_weight? 23112022 Only for samplers
Default: "weight".
It mainly works for line transect at the moment, determining the width of the
line to be integrated. See the distance sampling example
https://inlabru-org.github.io/inlabru/articles/web/2d_lgcp_distancesampling.html}

\item{int.args}{List of arguments passed on to \code{ipoints}}

\item{...}{Unused additional arguments}
}
\value{
Integration points
}
\description{
Constructs an integration scheme for each domain, restricted by samplers
}
